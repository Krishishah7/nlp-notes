# Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging

POS tagging assigns grammatical roles such as noun, verb, adjective, etc., to words in a sentence.

## Why POS Tagging is Important
- Helps understand sentence structure
- Improves text analysis
- Used in parsing, translation, and information extraction

## English POS Tagging
English POS tagging can be performed using NLTK.

Example:
"Natural Language Processing helps computers"
- Natural → Adjective
- Processing → Noun
- helps → Verb

## Hindi POS Tagging
Hindi POS tagging requires trained language-specific models.
Stanza provides pretrained models for Hindi and uses Universal POS tags.

## Universal POS Tags (UPOS)
- NOUN → Noun
- VERB → Verb
- ADJ → Adjective
- AUX → Auxiliary verb
- ADP → Postposition
