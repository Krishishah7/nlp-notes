# Text Similarity

## What is Text Similarity?
Text similarity measures how closely two pieces of text are related based on their content.

## Common Approaches
- TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity
- Jaccard Similarity
- Word/Sentence Embeddings

## Cosine Similarity (Used)
Cosine similarity measures the angle between two text vectors and returns a value between 0 and 1.

## Why Cosine Similarity?
- Works well with sparse TF-IDF vectors
- Independent of document length
- Widely used in NLP applications

## Interpretation
- Value close to 1 → high similarity
- Value close to 0 → low similarity

## Use Cases
- Document matching
- Search engines
- Recommendation systems
