# Topic Modeling (LDA)

## What is Topic Modeling?
Topic modeling is an unsupervised NLP technique used to discover hidden themes in a collection of documents.

## LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)
LDA assumes:
- Each document is a mixture of topics
- Each topic is a mixture of words

## How It Works (High Level)
- Converts text into word count vectors
- Groups frequently co-occurring words
- Produces topics represented by top keywords

## Important Note
Topic labels are **not assigned automatically**.
They are **interpreted by humans** based on top words per topic.

## Classification vs Topic Modeling
- Classification is supervised and uses labels
- Topic modeling is unsupervised and discovers themes

## Use Cases
- Exploring large text corpora
- Content analysis
- Document clustering
