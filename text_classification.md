# Text Classification

## What is Text Classification?
Text classification assigns predefined labels to text documents based on their content.

## Types Covered
### Rule-Based Classification
- Uses keyword matching and if-else logic
- Simple, explainable, and fast
- No training data required

### ML-Based Classification
- Uses machine learning models
- Learns patterns from labeled data
- More flexible and scalable

## ML Pipeline Used
- Text preprocessing
- TF-IDF vectorization
- Naive Bayes classifier
- Evaluation using accuracy and classification report

## Key Learnings
- Stratified train-test split preserves class balance
- Small datasets can lead to unstable metrics
- ML-based methods outperform rules at scale

## Use Cases
- Spam detection
- Intent classification
- Topic categorization
