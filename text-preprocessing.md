# Text Preprocessing in NLP

Text preprocessing is the first and most important step in Natural Language Processing.
It converts raw text into a clean and structured format suitable for analysis.

## Common Preprocessing Steps

### Tokenization
Splits text into individual words or tokens.
Example:
"I love NLP" → ["I", "love", "NLP"]

### Stopword Removal
Removes common words like "is", "the", "and" that add little meaning.

### Lowercasing
Converts all text to lowercase to maintain consistency.

### Stemming
Reduces words to their root form.
Example:
"running" → "run"

### Lemmatization
Converts words to their dictionary base form.
Example:
"better" → "good"

## Stemming vs Lemmatization
- Stemming is fast but may produce incorrect words.
- Lemmatization is slower but more accurate.
